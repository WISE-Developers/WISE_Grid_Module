/**
 * Vector data is provided to the simulation engine by the client application.  The simulation engine defines the interface it will use to obtain the vector fuel break data.  The simulation engine is not concerned with the kind of object that implements this interface, or the implementation of the object.  It may represent the GIS vector-based data, a user-defined static vector fuelbreak, or a user-controlled break that changes over time, or some other object a programmer has built to access a specialized data set.
 * The simulation engine does not define any object that implements this interface.  The simulation engine only defines the interface.  Objects that implement this interface should import this interface definition.  The object implementing this interface is to be handled entirely by the client application (such as CWFGM).  Methods to import vector data or manage vector filters are not found on this COM interface, as the simulation engine has no need for these methods.
 * This design takes advantage of object-oriented methodologies to simplify both the design of the simulation engine, and the integration of the simulation engine into another application.  For example, to provide data from a G.I.S. directly to the simulation engine, the programmer only needs to define an object that implements this interface and communicates with the G.I.S.
 * Unlike ICWFGM_GridEngine interface objects that must be chained (layered) together to attain the appropriate grid layer for the simulation, objects implementing this interface don't replace or override other vector object data, they are only combined.  As such, the order is unimportant so there are no methods to chain ICWFGM_VectorEngine objects together here.  The simulation's scenario object can use many ICWFGM_VectorEngine objects simultaneously.
 * At this time, the simulation engine assumes that fuel breaks defined by this interface have 100% effect on the fire; the fire will not escape the confines of a vector fuel break.
 * 
 * The IDL of the vector object required by the simulation engine is given below.  Program developers are encouraged to obtain the latest electronic copy of the programming tools from the resources listed at the end of this document.
